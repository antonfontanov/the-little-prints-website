This folder is generated by `scripts/convert-to-shopify-theme.js`.

How to use:
- Run `npm run build` to create the `dist` folder.
- Run `node scripts/convert-to-shopify-theme.js` to generate `shopify-theme/`.
- The resulting `shopify-theme/` folder contains a minimal Shopify-compatible theme structure. Copy its contents into a GitHub repo and connect to Shopify (Upload theme via the Shopify admin or use Theme Kit/Shopify CLI).

Pushing to GitHub
- Initialize a local repo and push the `shopify-theme` folder as a new repository or inside a repo you manage. Example (PowerShell):

```powershell
# from project root
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: The Little Prints"
# add remote - replace URL with your GitHub repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

If you want the `shopify-theme` to be its own repo, create the repo on GitHub first, then from inside the `shopify-theme` folder run the commands above.

Notes and limitations:
- This is a minimal automated conversion intended to help upload static assets and an index template. It does not convert dynamic server-side routes or React hydration. For a fully interactive Shopify storefront, consider building a Hydrogen app or using Shopify's Storefront API.
- You may need to adapt asset references and add `sections`, `snippets`, and `config` required by Shopify themes.
